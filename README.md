## **_Description_**

### The design of this game is a memory game where beer is to be matched with its appropriate glassware.

## **_Rules_**

### Cards are to be selected by revealing and matching an image of either a beer or glassware. By clicking on a cell the "cards" will flip and blackout on the grid if they match up. IF cards do not match then they flip back over. When the game is complete the boards will reset and shuffle the "cards" in random order.
